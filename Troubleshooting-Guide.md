## Reasons of extension breakdown
### Idle Chrome tab
Chrome actively manages system resources to ensure smooth performance and prevent individual processes from consuming too much memory or CPU. Service workers, while powerful for enabling offline capabilities and background tasks, can become resource-intensive if left running indefinitely in the background, especially for tabs that aren't actively being used.

To optimize resource usage, Chrome employs a strategy of identifying and killing idle service workers. This means that if a service worker hasn't been actively handling events or performing tasks for a certain period, Chrome considers it idle and reclaims the resources it's using.

**How This Impacts the PSAT Extension:**
If the PSAT extension relies heavily on its service worker for core functionality (such as data processing, background synchronization, or handling events even when the tab isn't in focus), the premature termination of this service worker can disrupt the extension's operations. This disruption could manifest as:

- The extension becoming unresponsive.
- Loss of data or settings.
- Features of the extension ceasing to work.
- Error messages or crashes within the extension.

**In essence, the scenario you're describing highlights a potential conflict between Chrome's aggressive resource management for idle tabs and the operational requirements of the PSAT extension's service worker.**  If the extension needs its service worker to remain active even when the associated tab is idle, Chrome's default behavior can lead to instability.

### Data Conflicts
At its core, a data conflict occurs when different pieces of information within the PSAT extension become inconsistent, contradictory, or out of sync. Think of it like two people trying to edit the same document simultaneously but making conflicting changes without a proper way to reconcile them.

Within the PSAT extension, this could manifest in various ways as you interact with its features and try out different sequences of actions. For example:

- **Overlapping Operations:** Running multiple functions or processes at the same time might lead to conflicts in how data is being read and written.
- **Unexpected Interactions:** Certain combinations of features or settings, while seemingly logical, might interact in unforeseen ways, leading to data inconsistencies.
- **Race Conditions:** If different parts of the extension try to access or modify the same data in an unpredictable order, it could result in a conflict.


#### Impact of Data Conflicts
When a data conflict arises, the PSAT extension might struggle to operate correctly. This can manifest as:

- **Unexpected Behavior:** Features might not work as intended, or you might see unusual results.
- **Freezing or Unresponsiveness:** The extension might become stuck or take a long time to respond to your actions.
- **Error Messages:** You might encounter error notifications within the extension.
- **Loss of Data (in some rare cases):** While we aim to prevent this, severe data conflicts could potentially lead to temporary data loss.

### Chrome Updates
Chrome updates can introduce changes that affect how extensions operate. These updates may include modifications to the browser's underlying architecture, security protocols, or extension APIs. While these updates are generally aimed at improving performance, security, and user experience, they can sometimes lead to compatibility issues with existing extensions.	

When a Chrome update occurs, it can disrupt the functionality of the PSAT extension in several ways:
- **API Changes:** If the update alters the APIs that the PSAT extension relies on, it may lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
- **Security Restrictions:** New security measures might prevent the extension from accessing certain resources or performing specific actions it previously could.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Changes in how Chrome manages resources, such as memory or CPU usage, can impact the extension's performance, leading to slowdowns or crashes.
- **Deprecation of Features:** If the update removes or deprecates features that the PSAT extension uses, it may lead to functionality loss or errors.
### Extension Updates
Similar to Chrome updates, updates to the PSAT extension itself can introduce changes that affect its functionality. These updates may include bug fixes, new features, or changes to existing functionality. While updates are generally intended to improve the extension, they can sometimes lead to compatibility issues with existing data or workflows.
When a PSAT extension update occurs, it can disrupt the functionality in several ways:
- **Data Migration Issues:** If the update changes how data is stored or processed, it may lead to errors or data loss during the migration process.
- **Feature Changes:** New features or changes to existing features may not work as expected, leading to confusion or errors.
- **Compatibility Issues:** If the update introduces changes that are not compatible with existing workflows or data, it may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
- **Bug Introductions:** While updates aim to fix issues, they can inadvertently introduce new bugs or regressions, leading to functionality breakdowns.

### User Actions
User actions can also lead to extension breakdowns. These actions may include:
- **Incorrect Usage:** Using the extension in ways that were not intended or tested can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. For example, trying to run multiple processes simultaneously or using features in an unsupported sequence can cause conflicts or data inconsistencies.
- **Data Corruption:** Manually modifying or corrupting the data used by the extension can lead to errors or unexpected behavior. This could include editing configuration files, tampering with stored data, or using unsupported formats.
- **Browser Settings Changes:** Changing browser settings that affect how extensions operate can lead to compatibility issues or errors. For example, disabling certain permissions or features that the PSAT extension relies on can disrupt its functionality.
- **Conflicting Extensions:** Other installed extensions may interfere with the PSAT extension's functionality. This can happen if multiple extensions try to access the same resources or modify the same data, leading to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
- **Network Issues:** If the PSAT extension relies on network connectivity for certain features, network issues can lead to errors or functionality breakdowns. This could include problems with internet connectivity, server availability, or API access.
- **Browser Crashes or Restarts:** If the browser crashes or is restarted while the PSAT extension is in use, it can lead to data loss or corruption, as well as unexpected behavior when the browser is reopened.

### Unknown Bugs

#### The Nature of Software Development

While the PSAT extension is developed with meticulous attention to detail, the dynamic nature of software and the vast array of user environments mean that unforeseen issues, or "bugs," can emerge. These often arise from unique or previously unencountered scenarios during real-world use.

Software development can be compared to exploring a vast, uncharted territory. Though common paths are thoroughly tested, unexpected conditions can lead to the extension behaving in unanticipated ways, potentially causing it to malfunction or "break."
