The Protected Audience API is a privacy-preserving technology that allows advertisers to show targeted ads without tracking user behavior across different websites. This approach eliminates the need for third-party cookies and prevents cross-site tracking, enhancing user privacy.

The Protected Audience API works by creating “interest groups” based on user interactions with specific websites or content. These interest groups are stored on the user's device, not on a central server. When a user visits a website that participates in the API, the browser checks for relevant interest groups and selects ads accordingly. This process happens locally, without sharing user data with third parties, thus enhancing privacy.

## Key Features
- **Interest Groups**: Websites can add users to interest groups based on their interactions. For example, if a user frequently visits a sports website, they might be added to a "sports" interest group.

- **Ad Selection**: When a user visits a participating website, the browser selects ads from the interest groups stored on the user's device. This selection is done without sharing user data with advertisers or third parties.

- **Privacy**: The API is designed to protect user privacy by keeping interest groups on the user's device and not sharing personal data with advertisers.

- **Transparency**: Users can view and manage their interest groups through browser settings, allowing them to opt-out of interest-based advertising if they choose.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Privacy**: By eliminating third-party cookies and cross-site tracking, the Protected Audience API enhances user privacy.

- **Targeted Advertising**: Advertisers can still show relevant ads to users based on their interests without compromising privacy.

- **User Control**: Users have control over their interest groups and can manage their preferences easily.
