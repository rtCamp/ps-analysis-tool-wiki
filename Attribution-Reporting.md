The Attribution Reporting API is a Privacy Sandbox proposal that enables advertisers to measure ad campaign performance while protecting user privacy. It replaces cross-site tracking with two report types: event-level and aggregate, associating ad interactions with conversions.

>[!NOTE]
>Advertisers and publishers that rely on ad tech platforms for conversion measurement don't need to use the API directly. You may be interested in understanding how Attribution Reporting works if your ad tech plans to integrate with this API.
