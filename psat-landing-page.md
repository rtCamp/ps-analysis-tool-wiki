DevTools provides a very large set of powerful capabilities enabling the understanding and debugging of every functional aspect of web development, including cookies and all storage APIs. PSAT expands DevTools with additional features to support tackling the deprecation of unrestricted 3P cookies, and the adoption of new privacy-preserving building blocks (i.e. Chrome APIs).

### PSAT Landing Page

To access PSAT, access the URL that you want to analyze, open Chrome DevTools, and navigate to the "Private Sandbox" panel.

PSAT features and capabilities aim at supporting developers transition smoothly towards a more private web, by shedding light on cookie usage, and the new building blocks available for implementing privacy-preserving solutions for features and capabilities of websites and apps. PSAT's landing paghe in DevTools reflects this goal:
