Explorable explanations represent a new form of interactive media, empowering readers to actively engage with and explore complex ideas and concepts.  They function as "reactive documents," allowing readers to manipulate the author's assumptions and analyses, directly observing the resulting consequences.

The core idea is to move beyond passive reading and create documents designed for interaction.  The goal is to provide a more engaging and interactive experience, particularly for understanding complex logic and concepts, such as those within the Privacy Sandbox APIs.

By interacting with these explanations, readers can explore the impact of different assumptions, for example, joining various interest groups.  This allows for a deeper understanding of processes like auctions and bidding.

In summary, explorable explanations are a powerful new interactive medium that can significantly improve comprehension of complex topics, especially those related to the Privacy Sandbox APIs. They offer a valuable tool for both developers and advertisers, enhancing accessibility and engagement with intricate concepts.
