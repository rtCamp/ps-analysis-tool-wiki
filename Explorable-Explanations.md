Explorable explanations represent a new form of interactive media, empowering readers to actively engage with and explore complex ideas and concepts.

They function as "reactive documents," allowing readers to manipulate the author's assumptions and analyses, directly observing the resulting consequences.

### How PSAT uses Explorable Explanations
The PSAT extension contains two explorable explanations for the Topics API and the Protected Audience API. It helps users view and interact with them and check how they react at each step.

#### [Topics API](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ps-analysis-tool/wiki/Topics-EE)
The Explorable Explanations provide a visual representation of how the Topics API assigns topics to users based on their Browse behavior. Users can visit different nodes, and as they interact, they are assigned to different topics.

#### [Protected Audience API](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ps-analysis-tool/wiki/Protected-Audience-EE)
The demo is structured to simulate a user's online journey, showcasing the interactions between different types of websites (nodes) and the dynamic processes involved in ad auctions. As a user visits an advertiser node, they are added to interest groups. When they visit a publisher's website, these interest groups are accessed, and an auction happens.
