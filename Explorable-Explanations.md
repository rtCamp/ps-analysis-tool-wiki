Explorable explanations represent a new form of interactive media, empowering readers to actively engage with and explore complex ideas and concepts.

They function as "reactive documents," allowing readers to manipulate the author's assumptions and analyses, directly observing the resulting consequences.

The core idea is to move beyond passive reading and create documents designed for interaction.

The goal is to provide a more engaging and interactive experience, particularly for understanding complex logic and concepts, such as those within the Privacy Sandbox APIs.

By interacting with these explanations, readers can explore the impact of different assumptions, for example, joining various interest groups. 

This allows for a deeper understanding of processes like auctions and bidding.

### Key characteristics of Explorable Explanations

- **Interactive:** The user can manipulate variables or parameters in real-time and immediately see the effect.

- **Visual:** Concepts are often illustrated with dynamic graphs, animations, or diagrams.

- **Explanatory:** They guide the user through a narrative or concept step-by-step, often combining traditional text with interaction.

- **User-driven:** Users “learn by doing” rather than just reading or listening.

- **Open-ended or Playful:** Often designed to encourage curiosity and experimentation.

### Why are Explorable Explanations effective?

- They engage active learning instead of passive consumption.

- They allow trial-and-error learning through experimentation.

- They cater to visual and kinesthetic learners.

- They make abstract concepts more tangible and intuitive.

- They encourage curiosity, which can lead to deeper understanding.

### How PSAT Uses Explorable Explanations
The PSAT extension contains two explorable explanations for the Topics API and the Protected Audience API. It helps users view and interact with demos and check how they react at each step.

#### [Topics API](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ps-analysis-tool/wiki/Topics-EE)
The Explorable Explanations provide a visual representation of how the Topics API assigns topics to users based on their Browse behavior. Users can visit different nodes, and as they interact, they are assigned to different topics.

#### [Protected Audience API](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ps-analysis-tool/wiki/Protected-Audience-EE)
The demo is structured to simulate a user's online journey, showcasing the interactions between different types of websites (nodes) and the dynamic processes involved in ad auctions. As a user visits an advertiser node, they are added to interest groups. When they visit a publisher's website, these interest groups are accessed, and an auction happens.
