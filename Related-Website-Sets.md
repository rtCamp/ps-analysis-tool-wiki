The component provides a Related Website Sets Generator, to help you create the resources needed for submitting a RWS definition request, as outlined in [the documentation](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/related-website-sets/blob/main/RWS-Submission_Guidelines.md).

1. Your contact information
1. Your primary domain
1. The specific `Associated Subsets` and the rationale for their inclusion.
1. The specific `Service Subsets` and the rationale for their inclusion.
1. The specific `ccTLD Subsets` and the rationale for their inclusion.
