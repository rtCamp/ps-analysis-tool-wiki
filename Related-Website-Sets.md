The 'Membership' tab displays RWS membership information if the current top-level site belongs to an RWS that is approved in the [canonical RWS list](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/related-website-sets/blob/main/related_website_sets.JSON).

The component provides a Related Website Sets Generator to help you create the resources needed for submitting an RWS definition request, as outlined in [the RWS submission guidelines &#10548;](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/related-website-sets/blob/main/RWS-Submission_Guidelines.md).

1. The specific `Associated Subsets` and the rationale for their inclusion.
1. The specific `Service Subsets` and the rationale for their inclusion.
1. The specific `ccTLD Subsets` and the rationale for their inclusion.
