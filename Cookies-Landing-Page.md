Cuurently the cookie landing page provides an classification of observed cookies on a given page (total, first-party, third-party).

PSAT leverages, and contributes to, the [Open Cookie Database](https://github.com/jkwakman/Open-Cookie-Database), which is an open-source effort to describe and categorize cookies in the ecosystem. Using that DB, PSAT's provides a classification for some of the observed cookies, into the categories: Functional, Marketing, Analytics, and Uncategorized.

As PSAT continues to evolve rapidly, the cookie landing page will incorporate more information and insights about cookie usage and behaviors.
