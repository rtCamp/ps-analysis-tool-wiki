This wiki is intended to empower you in making your sites/applications ready for the upcoming deprecation of 3rd Party Cookies (3PC) and unpartitioned storage on Chrome, as part of the [Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com/) initiative. As such, it assumes you're familiar with cookies and how they're currently used, at least on your specific sites/applications.

The aim is to create a testing/evaluation methodology that will provide you with the necessary insights needed to implement changes. So, the wiki provides concrete strategies that will help in this process:

1. How to set up an [**Evaluation Environment**](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ps-analysis-tool/wiki/Evaluation-Environment) that will help predict what is likely to happen once the deprecation comes into effect.
1. How to identify specific aspects of the site that are likely to be affected, amongst other [**General Actions for Analysis**](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ps-analysis-tool/wiki/General-Analysis-Actions).
1. How to evaluate an existing component and/or user journey, to identify, triage and address issues, using various tools and resources including ready-made step-by-step instructions for common [**Analysis Scenarios**](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ps-analysis-tool/wiki/Analysis-Scenarios) and the [**Privacy Sandbox Analysis Tool (PSAT)**](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ps-analysis-tool/wiki/PSAT's-How-To).
1. How to [**Find Help and Report Issues**](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ps-analysis-tool/wiki/Reporting-Issues-and-Learning-More) that are encountered during this process.

In addition, within relevant contexts, it includes prompts and pathways for you to contribute your own use cases, provide feedback and seek even more guidance.
