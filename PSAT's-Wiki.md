Analyzing sites to understand the potential impact of the changes coming to Chrome as part of the PrivacySandbox initiative, encompasses several components:

* **Evaluation environment**. A controlled environment is set up to emulate the state of the platform once 3P cookies and unpartitioned storage are deprecated. This is achieved by leveraging various Chrome Release Channels (e.g. Chrome Canary, Chrome Beta) which enable the implementation of the new capabilities of Chrome, and essential developer tools such as Chrome DevTools and the Privacy Sandbox Analysis extension, which enable developers to delve deep into network requests, scrutinize cookies, and detect reported errors.

* **Testing Scope**. A primary goal of this methodology is to narrow down the evaluation space so developers can focus systematically on specific aspects of their sites and applications:

* **3P Technologies**: Evaluate all third-party technologies to discern their dependency on 3P cookies and the potential fallout from their deprecation.

1P Features: Thoroughly review essential first-party features and CUJs.

QA/Testing Steps. Testing sequences for different components or user journeys. For instance, in checkout flows, validate the cart functionality and payment processing; if discrepancies or issues arise, follow a specific process to identify, triage, and address them.

* **Reporting**. Aggregated data reports presented via dashboards, providing clarity and insights to strategic decision-making on addressing the transition to Privacy Sandbox.
